The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers by Robert C. Martin http://amzn.to/2EqFxlb
Compared to Law, Medicine, Engineering, Accounting, Programming is a relatevely easy field to enter. There're countless success stories of self-thought programmers. This book introduces to what a Professional Programmer is. The author shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act.

Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin http://amzn.to/2ssThWJ
Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn't have to be that way. " Another book by Uncle Bob, it is an opinionated book, but full of wonderful resources and advice on how to improve your code.

Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design by Robert C. Martin http://amzn.to/2Bsq7dd
Yet another book by Uncle Bob. This is an anticipated guide to Software Architecture. Soon to be a best seller like the other Clean Series.

IT management is your ultimate goal? Read this book! Written in the 80s,it outlines the major issues with current management practices in software development field. It's amazing that most companies still make the same mistakes. If you won't move into management, at least this book will help you ask the right questions and look for red flags next time you're looking for a new job. Personally, I cannot chuckle inside when I hear "Open space office"

The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S Skiena  http://amzn.to/2BszJ7S

The book covers Design Paterns just like the Head First Design Patterns, but this book goes deeper in the world of OOP, software architecture and Agile Methodology.

Working Effectively with Legacy Code by Michael Feathers http://amzn.to/2HaEKlY
Legacy Code - You can hate it, but you cannot kill it. All code will be legacy at the end ;) Unless you're a hobby programmer, you will end up working with it. You will pull your hair out because of it. This book is sanity shield that we all need. Good Read!

Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design http://amzn.to/2CiYsZe
